# 🎵 Music With Octave

> ✨ *Where sine waves sing and scripts become symphonies* ✨

Welcome to **Music With Octave** — a melodic mashup of **mathematics, music, and imagination**. This project transforms **simple equations** into **famous tunes**, **classical scales**, and **harmonic textures**, all coded with care in **GNU Octave**.

No synthesizer? No piano? No problem. All you need here is **math, a little code, and a love for sound**.

---

## 🔍 What Is This?

**Music With Octave** is an open-source experiment where musical notes are crafted using **pure sine waves** — the simplest sound wave possible. Through the magic of math and frequency, we've brought to life childhood classics like:

- 🌟 *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*
- 🎂 *Happy Birthday*
- 🎵 *Sa Re Ga Ma Pa* (Indian classical scale)
- 🎧 Custom harmonic tones and decaying notes

All of this happens in **Octave**, a powerful open-source programming language for numerical computation — no VSTs, no audio plugins — just **bare sine waves and your curiosity**.

## 🧰 What’s Inside?

| File                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `twinkle.m`         | Plays the classic nursery rhyme using sine tones |
| `twinklelyrics.m`   | Same song, but with **lyrics displayed in real time** like a karaoke machine |
| `happybirthday.m`   | Everyone’s favorite birthday tune, pure and code-powered |
| `saregama.m`        | The **Indian musical scale**, generated step-by-step and then reversed |
| `music2.m`          | Adds **realism** to tones with decaying envelopes and amplitude shaping |
| `harmonics2.m`      | Synthesizes rich harmonic textures and saves them as `.wav` files |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. 🎧 Install **GNU Octave** (v4.2.1 or newer)
2. 📂 Open this repository in Octave
3. ▶️ Run any script:
   ```octave
   >> twinkle
🔊 Sit back and enjoy your CPU's musical talents!

To play with synchronized lyrics:

octave
Copy
Edit
>> twinklelyrics
